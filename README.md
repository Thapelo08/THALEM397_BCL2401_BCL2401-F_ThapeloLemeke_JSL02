# DISCRIPTION

-In This code I am duplicating the fitness goal section that when i enter the very same Goal,it reports to me at the top that the Goal already aexists
-In that code,The code selects all list items within an element with the identifier goalList and stores them in a constant called goals. A loop is started to iterate over each item in the goals NodeList. If the text content matches the variable goalInput, an alert message is displayed, and the loop is exited.

# Challenges

-The challenges that i had was that when i entered the fitness goal again it kept making a list of what i was writing, so when i revist the code there was an issue with my typo which i fixed it and it is duplicating.

# What i learned

- I learnt how to use function as it appeared a lot in the code  but i still ned revisit and practice more.
